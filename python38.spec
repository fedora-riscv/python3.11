%description
Python is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming
language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{name} package provides the "python3" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{name}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{name}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{name}-tkinter and %{name}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{name}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{name}-" prefix.

Summary: Debug version of the Python runtime

Requires: %{name}-tkinter%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-idle%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag ("d") in the filename,
so extensions for both versions can co-exist in the same directory.

# No need to split things out the "Makefile" and the config-32/64.h file as we

%endif # with debug_build

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from ldconfig
# See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %%__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)

# Workaround for https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1476593
