%description -n %{pkgname}
Python %{pybasever} is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The %{pkgname} package provides the "%{exename}" executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the %{pkgname}-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with %{pkgname}.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
%{pkgname}-tkinter and %{pkgname}-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the %{pkgname}-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the "%{pkgname}-" prefix.

%description -n %{pkgname}-debug
python3-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime. Python modules -- source (.py), bytecode (.pyc), and C-API extensions
(.cpython*.so) -- are compatible between this and the standard version
of Python.

The debug runtime additionally supports debug builds of C-API extensions
(with the "d" ABI flag) for debugging issues in those extensions.

# We put the debug-gdb.py file inside /usr/lib/debug to avoid noise from ldconfig
# See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562980
#
# The /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros defines %%__debug_package to use
# debugfiles.list, and it appears that everything below /usr/lib/debug and
# (/usr/src/debug) gets added to this file (via LISTFILES) in
# /usr/lib/rpm/find-debuginfo.sh
#
# Hence by installing it below /usr/lib/debug we ensure it is added to the
# -debuginfo subpackage
# (if it doesn't, then the rpmbuild ought to fail since the debug-gdb.py
# payload file would be unpackaged)
